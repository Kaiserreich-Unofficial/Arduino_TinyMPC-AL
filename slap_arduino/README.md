# Using `slap` in Arduino Projects

The `slap` library is written to be entirely compatible with
Arduino projects. 

It will (hopefully) be registered as an official Arduino package
at some point, but until then, follow these instructions 
for incorporating it into your Arduino projects.

## Arduino IDE 2.0 for ease

1. Follow this [tutorial](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/tutorial.html) to know how to install and use tools.

2. Put `arduino_slap` folder to `~/Arduino/libraries`

4. Start Arduino IDE, open `test_slap/test_slap.ino`, compile and upload.
